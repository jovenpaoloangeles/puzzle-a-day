# AlgorithmX Problems and Solvers

Trying to efficiently write a program to provide me solutions to [Dragonfjord's
"A Puzzle a Day"](https://www.dragonfjord.com/product/a-puzzle-a-day/) has lead
me down a slightly mind boggling path of learning what about Donald Knuth's
[AlgorithmX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X), as well as
[Exact Cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover), and
[Dancing Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links)
algorithms. I am definitely not an expert in this algorithm, but was able to get
something working with the help of Ali Assaf's post and implementation of AlgorithmX.

The examples in this repository can solve Sudoku and Pentomino puzzles relativly
quickly. While all these examples work in Python3, I highly recomend using
[pypy](https://www.pypy.org/download.html) as it is much faster for these types
of problems.

## Example Pentomino Solver
```python
from pentomino import Puzzle

BOARD = """
â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«â¬›â¬›
ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«
ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«
ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›
"""
PIECES = """
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª â¬›ğŸŸ¦â¬› â¬›ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬› ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬›ğŸŸªâ¬› ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬› ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬› â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ©
"""

solver = Puzzle(BOARD, PIECES, allow_reflections=True)
solutions = list(solver.find_solutions())
for board in solutions:
    print(board)

>>>
â¬›â¬›ğŸŸªğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬›â¬›
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›
```

## Example Dragonfjord Command Line Solver
Only a single random solution is displayed when running from the command line
as seeing all solutions was a bit unwieldy.
```bash
> python3 puzzle-a-day.py --date=2025-05-29
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬›ğŸŸ§â¬›
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§â¬›
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ§â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«ğŸŸ«
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬›ğŸŸªğŸŸªâ¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›

Found 66 solutions after 5.5s.
