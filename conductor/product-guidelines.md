# Product Guidelines - Puzzle-A-Day Solutions

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic**: Material Design inspired. The interface should use clean lines, subtle shadows, and a vibrant, intentional color palette to differentiate the pentomino pieces.
- **Typography**: Clean, sans-serif fonts to maintain a modern and highly legible look.
- **Color Palette**: A distinct color for each of the 12 pentomino pieces, ensuring they are easily identifiable against the board.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Hint Mode Tone**: Encouraging and helpful. The progressive reveal of pieces should be accompanied by soft animations to guide the user without making the experience feel like "cheating."
- **Transitions**: Seamless and instant. Navigation between dates should be nearly instantaneous, utilizing smooth cross-fade animations to maintain a fluid user experience.

## Accessibility
- **Color Blindness Support**: Pieces must be distinguishable by more than just color. This can be achieved through distinct piece labels, subtle patterns, or by ensuring sufficient contrast between adjacent pieces.
- **Responsive Design**: The application must be fully functional and visually appealing on mobile devices, as users may use it while playing with the physical board.

## Interaction Design
- **Date Navigation**: A clear, easy-to-use calendar interface.
- **Mode Switching**: Immediate visual feedback when toggling between solution modes (e.g., reflections or smooth side).
