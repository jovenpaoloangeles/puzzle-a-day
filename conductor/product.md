# Product Definition - Puzzle-A-Day Solutions

## Initial Concept
A web application that displays daily puzzle solutions for the "Puzzle-A-Day" board game. This project features a decoupled architecture that separates the React application from the puzzle data, optimizing deployment efficiency and client-side performance.

## Target Audience
- **Puzzle Enthusiasts**: Individuals who own the physical "Puzzle-A-Day" board game and are looking for solutions or help when they get stuck.

## Value Proposition
- **Instant Solutions**: Provides immediate access to pre-computed solutions for every day of the year without needing to wait for a solver to run.
- **Progressive Assistance**: Future "Hint Mode" will offer a middle ground between being stuck and seeing the full solution.

## Core Features
- **Daily Solutions**: Navigate to any date in the year to see a pre-computed solution.
- **Interactive UI**:
    - **Date Picker**: Intuitive calendar navigation for quick date selection.
    - **Solution Mode Toggles**: Toggle between different solution types (Rough Side Only, With Reflections, Smooth Side Only).
    - **High-Quality Rendering**: Clear, visual representation of the puzzle board and pentomino pieces.
    - **Deep Linking**: Shareable URLs that link directly to a specific date's solution.

## Roadmap & Future Vision
- **Hint Mode**: Implementation of a progressive reveal system that shows pieces one by one to guide the user toward the solution.
